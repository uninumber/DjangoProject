# DjangoProject
## Actually just making empty html page was not really cool, so i did this more readable.
### This project has:
* Login/Logout/Register functional (for making reviews on products)
* GET /item/{id}
* GET /buy/{id}
* Docker build(just build(/snap/bin/docker build . -t docker-django)
* Model Order with Discount
* Admin Panel for discussions

## I'm not lazy, i have not time:( because of this i mad just set(ssd+keyboard), but actually can do for every item.
